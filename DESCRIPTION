Description: This package takes the raw results output after performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the website for the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP, http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/). It organizes the results into a more easily readable format. It can also accept a binary phenotype file and use this to perform additionary analyses such as odds ratios.
